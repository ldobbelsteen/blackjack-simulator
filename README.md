# Blackjack Simulator

A sophisticated blackjack simulator that takes the Monte Carlo approach to calculating blackjack odds. It aims to be fast, which is achieved by using multithreading. It also aims to be correct, staying as close as possible to real-world blackjack. The engine supports a variety of house rules, which are configurable in the web interface, where the player strategy can also be modified. This project is hosted on [here](https://blackjack.dobbel.dev), where more info can be found.
