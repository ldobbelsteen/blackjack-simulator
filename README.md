# Blackjack Simulator

A sophisticated blackjack simulator written in JavaScript with a clean web interface. It uses web workers to make use of the full power of the client's device. The engine supports a variety of house rules, which are configurable in the web interface, where the player strategy can also be modified. This project is hosted on [my website](https://blackjack.dobbel.dev).
