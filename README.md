# Blackjack Simulator

A sophisticated blackjack simulator that takes the Monte Carlo approach to calculating blackjack odds. It's both fast and correct at the same time, and uses multithreading to achieve this. The engine supports a variety of house rules, which are configurable in the web interface, where the player strategy can also be modified. This project is hosted on [my website](https://blackjack.dobbel.dev), where more info can be found.
